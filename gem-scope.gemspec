	s.description = <<-EOD
`Scoping` is the ability to use gems only in special environments
(called scopes as there is already 'gem environment').
It is similar in spirit to [rip](https://github.com/defunkt/rip)
although designed to be a drop-in beauty.
Simple, less features, whatever. Enjoy if you like :)

It has *no* dependencies :) (other than rubygems, admittedly)
